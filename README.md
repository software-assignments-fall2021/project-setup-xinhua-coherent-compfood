# Building (for development only)

## Front-end

We are using `npm` as our package manager and React as our framework. Steps to run:

1. cd to the front-end directory

```
cd $(git root)/front-end
```

2. install relevant packages

```
npm install
```

3. launch React server (with PR #15, will be accessable at [http://127.0.0.1:61002](http://127.0.0.1:61002))

```
npm start
```
